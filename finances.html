    <h2>Our Financial Philosophy</h2>
    <p>As game organisers (Adam and Dex) We will be making no profit from this game and neither will our business which currently is fundamentally Not for profit. We want to create a beautiful piec of art and experience for our community and 
      give back to a community who have ultimately crafted us into the people we are.</p>
    <p>We believe that anyone who creates art work for our game deserves to paid, along with writers, prop makers, and social consultants. This is where the remains of the ticket price after venue costs will go. 
      We do not believe these people can be underpaid and will evenly recieve their earning per hour worked if per product isn't appropriate.</p>
    <p>After the game has finished we intend to supply the community with our finances and our expedniture so they can see where their ticket was spent. This is equally an opportunity for the community to give us feedback on how we have spent the 
      money.</p>
