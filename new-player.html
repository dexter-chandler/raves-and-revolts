    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

        <section> We recognise fully that at first, Vampire: The Masquerade can appear unapproachable, and
          overwhelming. The setting and universe contains a plethora of terminology, references, and
          niche language that can be alienating to people who are wanting to explore the world, but
          have no prior experience.
        </section>

        <section>Especially when trying to craft the story you as a player want to tell, or figure out how your
          character fits into the World of Darkness; it is completely understandable to feel
          overwhelmed and confused.
        </section>
    <section> As Organisers, we remember how disorienting and disheartening this can be. We've been in
      those shoes before! It's jarring! Were it not for a community that was willing to walk us
      through it, we'd never have got to enjoy this setting that we adore.
    </section>
        <section> Whilst this page is attempting to emulate that, we recognise that it will likely not cover all
          possible questions that our players may have. Please, if you have any further questions
          about the setting or terminology that has been used throughout this website, or in
          conversations in our Discord, feel free to ask the game team (or even your fellow players if
          you feel comfortable). We'd love to help!
        </section>
    <h2 id="what">What is Vampire the Masquerade?</h2>

    <section> The universe in which our game takes place is a setting rife with monsters. Vampires,
Werewolves, Ghosts: they are all very real. Not only do they exist, but they walk amongst the
world, as neighbours, colleagues, lovers and friends. In the World of Darkness, the stories
that make up the myths of the supernatural are all real - and they are all far more monstrous
than anyone could have imagined.</section> 

    <section>In Vampire: The Masquerade, you are playing one of these very beings. A supernatural
Vampire, who was once human, and has been dragged into the shadows by a predator,
forcing you to be a part of their sordid world whether you like it or not. Every Vampire is a
monster, clinging to remnants of their humanity - of who they once were, and how the world
once looked. Every night they awaken, cursed, damned, hungry. Their condition is parasitic -
subsisting off of the lifeblood of a flock to which they used to belong.
</section>
    <section>To be a Vampire, is to stalk the night: navigating centuries of intrigue and chaos. Centuries of
archaic traditions, rules, and religions merged with the modern understanding of technology,
and the world. Politics, violence, carnality and betrayal are their currency, all in the pursuit of
survival now that they find themselves amongst the ranks of the Damned.
</section>
    <section>The horror is personal. You are the monster. You exist as a bastardisation of humanity, and
the sinful urges that exist on the worlds periphery. Preternatural powers flow through your
veins, with unbound potential. At its core, Vampire: The Masquerade is a tale of conflict,
between the limits of morals and humanity in the face of eternal monstrosities: given form in
each and every character</section>

        <h2 id="sects">What are the Sects?</h2>
    <section>A sect, in the most simplistic of senses, is socio-political body formed up of like-minded
groups of Vampires. In most cases, they have a distinct ideology that they, and all their
members, adhere to. These organisations carry their own hierarchies, and internal political
positions and structures: with their own interests, and approaches to tackling the events of
the world in which they inhabit. They are a means of communal survival. They are warring
bodies, vying for control of the Vampire world - each espousing a worldview they hold to be
true. No one survives alone, and every Lick is forced to choose a side eventually.</section>

  <section>In the setting, there are two main sects - the third having fallen for a multitude of reasons
before the turn of the millennium. They consist of The Anarchs, and The Camarilla. Our
Game is an Anarch event, and so the majority - if not all - of the player characters will belong
to this organisation. However, when it comes to warring political bodies that run the world for
Vampires, even members of one group are aware of how the other works! How else are they
meant to have opinions on why the other is awful, or why they're on the right side of the war
in the first place?
</section>
            <h2 id="camarilla">Who are the Camarilla?</h2>
    <section>It is much harder to grasp the motivations of The Anarch movement without first
understanding the sect that they are actively subverting: The Camarilla. The Camarilla is,
and has been, the defacto and ruling political body for Vampires in Europe since it's
foundation, almost seven hundred years ago. They are the puppeteers in the shadows,
attempting to control mortal society from behind the scenes: all in the pursuit of ensuring the
survival of themselves, and the elders to which they answer. A true propaganda marvel:
members of the Camarilla are indoctrinated into a worldview dictated to them by their Elders.
With the ban on technology in place, there is very little reason to believe otherwise, and
contradicting those above you is often met with an iron fist.
</section>

    <Section>Each cell of the Camarilla, called a Court, is allocated control over a Domain - typically cities
and counties in the U.K. - which they are charged with maintaining by the Elders above them
in their pecking order. Each court is made up of positions, which are often fought over within
these courts. These positions are as follows:</Section>

    <section>In years past, the Anarchs and Camarilla were nominally aligned in war against the Sabbat.
An alliance of necessity, if nothing else: as the Anarchs were never truly powerful enough to
deny this demand, and simply had to bend the knee to their oppressors. With the Sabbat
gone, and The Second Inquisition barking at their doors; the Camarilla cut loose their ties
with the Anarchs, declaring open war on their previous allies. Simply, the Elders saw them
as too much of a threat to their safety, and the safety of their Masquerade. Leaving The
Camarilla is no small feat, and in turn many are hunted down for doing so.</section>
    
    <h2 id="prince">Prince</h2>
    <section>The Tyrants at the top of the court, it is the Prince who has the final say of what happens in a
Camarilla territory. She decides where the court is held, when it happens, who is permitted
attendance, and who is banished. Typically they are the Eldest and most established
member of a Domain, the most powerful and most well connected. To deny a Prince, is to
court death at the hands of her court. They answer only to the most powerful members of the
sect - The Justicars and Archons - whose names are whispered in backrooms, and whose
appearance means death to a whole domain. The figureheads of the Camarilla, the Princes
embody everything the Anarchs disagree with.
</section>
 <h2 id="seneschal">Seneschal</h2>
    <section>The right hand of the Prince, it is the seneschal who acts as the head of the court when a
Prince is indisposed. They deal with any and all matters of importance that are not worthy of
the Princes time, and often act as a point of communication between the Primogen Council
and the Prince of a Domain. A position of seniority and respect amongst the court, no one
gets to be a Seneschal without fucking someone else over to get there.</section>
  <footer>
     <h2 id="herald">Herald</h2>
<section>The Herald is the voice of The Prince. They are tasked with communicating the rules and
whims of a Prince to their Domain. It is the Herald who informs the Domain of the rules of
each court, and of the arrival of influential kindred in the area.
</section>
<h2 id="primogen">Primogen Council</h2>
<section>The Primogen are an internal office within a Domain, made up of the Elder, or most
respected, member of each Clan in the Domain. They are tasked with ensuring each of their
clan tow the sect line, and with bringing a consensus on matters to the ear of the Prince.</section>
 <h2 id="sherif">Sheriff</h2>
   <section>It is the purview of the Sheriff to enforce the traditions of a Domain. They are the blunt
implement by which the Kindred in a Prince's domain is kept in line; and anyone caught
violating the Traditions likely meet their end following a short investigation at their hands.</section>
<h2 id="scourge">Scourge</h2>
    <section>As the name would suggest, the Scourge is a position granted to a vampire who holds a
vested interest in scouring the Domain of undesirables. Given free reign, without need for
investigation, to destroy those within a Domain that do not meet the Camarilla's standards
for kindred society - be that due to generation, clan, or the very nature of their Embrace. The
Scourge purges all.
</section>
    <h2 id="harpy">Harpy</h2>
    <section>Less of an official position, a Harpy becomes one simply by acting like a Harpy. They are the
trend setters, maintainers of the social status quo as well as providers of gossip and political
insight. They keep an eye of the movers and shakers in any Domain, and are a focal point
for people to find out who's who, and what's what at any court.
</section>
<h2 id="traditions">The Six Traditions</h2>
    <section>The members of The Camarilla adhere to The Six Traditions, as they were written at the end
of the dark ages. These traditions are as follows:</section>

   <h2>The Masquerade</h2>
<section> The most important tradition, the Masquerade ensure that Kindred keep themselves hidden
from mortal institutions. Since the inception of the Second Inquisition, this is more important
to the Camarilla than ever. </section>
<h2>The Domain</h2>
<section>
Much like empires of old, the Camarilla carves and divides the world geographically on the
basis of cities and territories, each Domain is allocated to a Prince. No kindred may cross these boarders without explicit permission.</section>
<h2>The Progeny</h2>
<section>
It is the this third tradition that ensures that a new Vampire is only created with the express
permission of the Elders in a Domain. These Elders, however, are rarely subjected to this
rule.</section>
The Accounting
"Those thou create are thine own Childer. Until thy Progeny shall be released, thou shall
command them in all things. Their sins are thine to ensure,"
A means of keeping track of what Vampires are born, and where. It is Accounting that makes
newly embraced Vampires slaves to their Sires, until a time where they are deemed worthy
to be seen as an individual.
The Hospitality
"Honour one another's Domain. When thou comest to a foreign city, thou shall present
thyself to the one who ruleth there. Without the word of acceptance, thou art nothing,"
To move between Domains, is to subject yourself to the rules of a new Court, and their rules.
If a vampire does not notify a superior of their travels, they are swiftly disposed of by the
Sheriff or Scourge.
The Destruction
"Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind. The right of Destruction belongeth only to
thine Elder. Only the eldest among thee shall call the Blood Hunt,"
Murder of another vampire is considered tantamount to signing your own death warrant in
the Ivory Tower. If someone has transgressed in an egregious manner it is the right of
Destruction that allows Elders to hunt them down.
Anyone caught breaking these traditions, or found in violation of a Prince's interpretation of
the rules, is disposed of. Those who are lucky, escape to the Anarchs.
