<h2>Lexicon</h2>

<section>KINDRED / LICK / ROACH / THE DAMNED: Various sobriquets or nicknames for a
vampire. Typically what they call each other.</section>
  
<section>THE EMBRACE: The process by which a human or other mortal becomes a vampire.</section>
        
<section>THE BEAST: The feral subconscious presence within each vampire. It is this that causes
them to commit acts of atrocity, and drives them to pursue their hunger. It is antithetical to
the concept of humanity.</section>
        
<section>HUNGER: The driving force of the beast; the hungrier a vampire is, the stronger and more
violent their beast becomes.</section>
        
<section>HUMANITY: The ways by which Kindred bind themselves to the mortals they once were. The leash on the beast, the struggle to appear human again. Inevitably, the older kindred get, and the more atrocities they commit, the more this decays. </section>
        
<section>GENERATION: The distance between a vampire, and the first ever vampire. Most player
characters are likely to be between 12th and 15th generation.</section>
        
<section>FRENZY: A term for when the beast takes control of the mind of a vampire due to a state of
agitation or anger. Can be triggered by various things, including feeling of intense
humiliation, or incredible pain.</section>
        
<section>FEAR FRENZY: A term for when the beast takes control of the mind of a vampire due to a
state of terror or fear. Can often be triggered by severe panic, or the sight of fire.</section>
        
<section>HUNGER FRENZY: A term for when the beast takes control of the mind of a vampire due to
being incredibly hungry, or not having fed in a very long time. Can be triggered by the sight
of blood, if appropriate.</section>
        
<section>WASSAIL: The point of no return. Wassail is when a vampire has no humanity left, and has
permanently succumbed to the beast.</section>
        
<section>MORTAL / KINE: Kindred term for a human.</section>
        
<section>WIGHT: A permanently frenzy vampire, who has succumbed to the wassail.</section>
        
<section>THE CAMARILLA / THE IVORY TOWER: The organisation politically, militarily, and
ideologically opposed to the Anarchs. (See full description of the sec for more information.)</section>
        
<section>CAMMIE: Derogatory term used amongst Anarchs to refer with disdain to members of the
Camarilla.</section>
        
<section>THE ANARCHS / THE UNBOUND: The sect politically, ideologically, and militarily opposed
to the Camarilla. The sect to which the majority of the player characters belong. (See full
description of the sect for more information.)</section>
        
<section>CLAN: A group of vampires all bound by the same weakness, bloodlines, and lineages.
They all share the same abilities to a degree, and have their own approaches and
perspectives to the world. (See Clan Page for further details and specifics.)</section>
        
<section>CURSE / CLAN WEAKNESS / CLAN BANES: The unique afflictions of each Clan. They are
permanent, and incurable, supernatural predispositions and compulsions.</section>
        
<section>CHILDE / CHILDER / PROGENY: A vampire that someone has chosen to embrace. Every
Vampire is the Childe of the person who embraced them.</section>
        
<section>SIRE: A vampire that has chosen to embrace another. The figure that passes the embrace
to another.</section>
        
<section>GHOUL: A mortal who has been fed the blood of a vampire, but not embraced. They are
typically blood bonded, and gain some level of enhanced strength and lifespan. They can be
human, or animal. The vampire who provides the blood is called a DOMITOR.</section>
        
<section>BLOOD BOND: By feeding their blood to another, or having another consume their own
blood, a vampire creates a blood bond. Repeated feeding increases this bond. At the lowest,
it simply makes the recipient inclined toward seeing the person whose blood they have drank
in a positive light, and at their most extreme the bonds can cause obsession and intense
love.</section>
        
<section>DIABLERIE / THE AMARANTH: The act of draining another vampire of all of their blood,
killing them. Rumoured to consume the soul of the victim. Deeply frowned upon, and the
person who commits the act is called a DIABLERIST.</section>
        
<section>FLEDGLING: A freshly embraced Vampire. They are usually between a few hours post
embrace, to around a year.</section>
        
<section>NEONATE: A vampire who has been around the block a few times. Older than a Fledgling,
but at most a decade old.</section>
        
<section>ANCILLAE: A reasonably well aged vampire, possibly multiple decades old. Younger than
an Elder, but some Fledglings might consider them to be such.</section>
        
<section>ELDER: A vampire who is a century or more old, A prince, A Baron 
Anachronistic, archaic, and ruthless.</section>
        
<section>METHUSELAH:More myth than reality in the
modern nights. A vampire of mythical age.</section>
        
<section>PROGENITOR / ANTEDILUVIAN: The godlike, ancient, mythical creatures that supposedly
gave birth to the clans.</section>
        
<section>CAINE: Of biblical fame, supposedly the first vampire. Condemned and cursed with
Vampirism, for the murder of Abel.</section>
        
<section>GEHENNA: A prophecy made of eight portents that will herald the end times, and the
extinction of all Vampires. No one can agree on the specific, but many Elders contend that
the arrival of Caitiff and Duskborn are one of the primary signs.</section>
        
<section>HUNTER / INQUISITOR: Someone who hunts down and exterminates Vampires and other
supernaturals, often affiliated with governments and ecclesiastical institutions. </section>
        
<section>VITAE / BLOOD: The blood of a mortal, or a Vampire. Sates the hunger of vampires.</section>
        
<section>DISCIPLINES / GIFTS OF THE BLOOD: Powers that are granted to Vampires by virtue of
their very existence. These vary from clan to clan, and bloodlines, with some cross over.</section>
        
<section>HAVEN: a group, or singular vampire's home, or base of operations.</section>
        
<section>SECT: A political, ideological, or military organisation of vampires. Spanning multiple clans,
and areas of the world.</section>

and agree with being together; a polycule of vampires who are all in love; or literally anything
else.</section>
