<h2> How is Coterie Creation Going to Work? </h2> 

<section>Coterie creation, much like character creation, will be completed by completing a form and submitting it to us as organisers. Unlike character generation however, only one individual from each group will be required to complete the form. As you can imagine, this serves a dual purpose. Primarily, this means that we will have one place detailing who is in what group, and what each group’s dynamic looks like. However, this also means that we will have a singular point of contact for each group, should we need to reach out to you for whatever reason. </section>

<section>With this in mind, it is important that each group works together to ensure that everyone has a voice in creating the group that they feel like they can play in and feel comfortable. It is important to remember that just because you’ve chosen a single person to submit the information to us, that doesn’t mean that they have the final say. At the end of the day, everyone is attending the event to enjoy themselves. </section>

<h2> What is a Coterie? </h2> 

<section>No one survives the perils of the world of darkness alone; least of all Anarchs. </section>

<section>Coteries are how they get by. Loosely speaking, a coterie is a group of licks who have - for whatever reason - banded together. This could be because they share a common goal, out of sheer circumstance, or because they are all deeply infatuated with one another. Some coteries are crafted through long-standing bonds; having faced war together and come out closer than before. Others may have found themselves victims of the same mass-embrace, and banded together simply to survive. </section>

<section>Whatever the reason, for the time being, a character’s coterie is the network with which they tackle the trials of their unlife. Playing in a coterie enables you to craft dynamics between yourselves and other players that you can then rely on in-play. It means that, in whatever fashion, you have a home with a group of familiar people during the game that you can fall back on to create game for each other. It also means that you have friends you can call upon to support you in a tough situation, should your character need the back-up. </section>

<section>Your coterie mates don’t have to be your character’s friends - hell you don’t even have to like each other in play - but at the very least, they serve as a place for your character to belong. </section>

<h2> What do You Need to Tell us? </h2> 

<section>As part of creating your coterie, we encourage you to give us an overview of the core themes and motivations that make up your concept. What is the glue that holds thes licks together? How do they intend to go about this? Are they a collective group of rabble rousers that thrive on violence, hellbent on burning down the Ivory Tower by any means necessary, or are they a group of sycophantic socialites that are part of the Anarchs to further their own goals and strengthen their grip on the mortal populace? </section>

<section>Do they have a specific business that they are trying to monopolise in the newly-forming Anarch state that Bristol is becoming? Maybe they’re a bunch of human trafficking blood-runners that work as part of the circulatory system, who see the Rave as a business opportunity - to scope out potential competition and begin to lay roots with the Baron and his ilk. Maybe, in light of all this, they are a ragtag group of thin-bloods trying to survive the night. </section>

<section>Whatever the case, you have the freedom to build up your group concept however you see fit - to bring the story you want to tell to the game. We will endeavour to build the world around these concepts, and it is unlikely that we will refuse your ideas (unless they are in stark contrast to the games themes as a whole). Coteries are much more nebulous in concept than characters. As such, don’t feel like you need to tell us everything if you don’t wish to; we just need enough to know the kind of game your groups will want to play into, and what narratives will be compelling to them. Afterall, there is no point in us writing occultist plot if there aren’t any coteries interested in uncovering the secrets of the antediluvians and gehenna. </section>

<h2> Joining a Coterie? </h2> 

<section>If you do not have a group, and are planning on attending the game alone, don’t relinquish yourself to the throes of despair just yet! If you do not have an intended group, we can help. </section>

<section>We will be releasing a separate form for those of you who are not already part of a coterie, so that we can put you together with others in a similar situation or invite you to join pre-existing groups. We firmly believe that Vampire as a setting is most fun and interesting when played as part of a group, and if possible we would like to have everyone working with each other to ensure nobody feels alienated or alone (at least Out of Character; that Ventrue definitely deserves to feel a little alienated after all!). </section>

<section>This form will be released alongside coterie creation, and once filled out we will reach out to notify yourselves of potential matches in dynamic! If it is absolutely essential to your experience at the game that you do not join a coterie, please do let us know and we will endeavour to work with you. </section>

<section>As always, if there are any concerns or queries please do not hesitate to reach out to us, so that we can work with you to resolve any and all issues if we can! </section>
