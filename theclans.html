      <h2 id="brujah"> The Brujah</h2>
      <p>
The Brujah are a clan of Idealists, Utopianists, and Philosophers. Dreaming of harmony between all things, and fighting tooth and nail to ensure that even in the darkest of nights, there is a place for such. 
Or so they have spent the last thousands of years preaching, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. In reality they are punks, rabble-rousers, and rioters. The path of the clan of Rebels is paved in bloodsoaked stone. 
Idealism is dangerous, infectious, and tantalising. They are cursed to spend every night trying to break the immortal shackles of kindred society.</p>

<p>Theirs is the fury of the downtrodden, the beaten, and the oppressed. Sheer optimism in the face of the darkening world around them. The Brujah see themselves as a voice of those who have none, a fist for those who cannot fight, 
and a boot on the neck of the oppressors. In bygone times, they were the beating heart of the Anarch movement. Ironic, really, given that there were just as many of them kissing the boots of the Ventrue. 
Trying to change things from the inside, as they would have it told.</p>

<p>There are, obviously, two sides to every coin, and a multitude of faces to every clan. Where you would be inclined to find Punks and Rebellious idealists amongst the Brujah number, you are just as likely to discover politicians, 
altruistic business folk, or extremists.</p>

<p>You can incite a rage in one Brujah, even mock them for their history and misunderstanding the world: but they are never alone. Where you find one, there are always more just a whistle away, waiting to get the job done if need be. 
    Be wary of the human face a monster might wear, when trying to sway you to their cause.

      <h2 id="malkavian">The Malkavians</h2>
      <p>
Clan Malkavian are a collective of individuals first and foremost. Much more like a dysfunctional family than anything else, they are comprised of seers, doctors, occultists and zealots. 
Where others may perceive enigma, riddle, and confusion: they gleam a stark and terrifying truth about the world. Unravelling the mysteries of the night by intuitively pulling on a thread, and seeing what around them begins to unfurl. 
The Children of Malkav are at their core, solvers and creators of problems. </p>

<p>For months and aeons, they have been the seer on the shoulder of kings, the collectors of trinkets with a common meaning, and the discerners of the best path forward. For seconds and lifetimes they have often been ignored. In the age of information, 
and the politicisation of every spoken word, the clan of the moon are the ones who see through the shit, and observe the predicted conclusions with rapturous applause.</p>

<p>Truly a clan of individuals, Malkavians are as likely to be an educated Doctor in life as they are to be a priest, or a nightclub owner. Condemned to forever find themselves perplexed with a nature they can never quite grasp. 
  A genius perpetually on the verge of a breakthrough, and prisoners who can simply never escape their sentence.</p>

<p>For kindred, truth is anything but objective. For a Malkavian, the truth is all they know, but they can never speak it clear enough for anyone else to comprehend. A fractured mirror, after all, can be pointed at an image, 
   and show its observer a thousand possibilities. Many make the mistake of simply relegating all Malkavians to the sidelines: but would you be content to see the world without all its nuance?</p>
