      <h2 id="brujah"> The Brujah</h2>
      <p>
The Brujah are a clan of Idealists, Utopianists, and Philosophers. Dreaming of harmony between all things, and fighting tooth and nail to ensure that even in the darkest of nights, there is a place for such. 
Or so they have spent the last thousands of years preaching, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. In reality they are punks, rabble-rousers, and rioters. The path of the clan of Rebels is paved in bloodsoaked stone. 
Idealism is dangerous, infectious, and tantalising. They are cursed to spend every night trying to break the immortal shackles of kindred society.</p>

<p>Theirs is the fury of the downtrodden, the beaten, and the oppressed. Sheer optimism in the face of the darkening world around them. The Brujah see themselves as a voice of those who have none, a fist for those who cannot fight, 
and a boot on the neck of the oppressors. In bygone times, they were the beating heart of the Anarch movement. Ironic, really, given that there were just as many of them kissing the boots of the Ventrue. 
Trying to change things from the inside, as they would have it told.</p>

<p>There are, obviously, two sides to every coin, and a multitude of faces to every clan. Where you would be inclined to find Punks and Rebellious idealists amongst the Brujah number, you are just as likely to discover politicians, 
altruistic business folk, or extremists.</p>

<p>You can incite a rage in one Brujah, even mock them for their history and misunderstanding the world: but they are never alone. Where you find one, there are always more just a whistle away, waiting to get the job done if need be. 
    Be wary of the human face a monster might wear, when trying to sway you to their cause.

      <h2 id="gangrel">The Gangrel</h2>
      <p>The lone wolf can only wander for so long, before it finds a pack to travel with or a land to call its own. Outcasts, rogues, vagrants and hunters, the Gangrel are a Clan of survivors, who have no time for elitism,
         or those who look down on the experiences of another. They do not abide by the laws of the countries in which they live, or the land in which they wander. The Feral will not be tamed by the words of a petty prince, 
         or a snivelling Baron. Carrying with them the stories of the civilisations they have crossed through, and the wisdom that comes with seeing where the foolish have failed. 
      </p>

<p>
The world, no matter how dark, is nothing to be shied away from. The ethos of the gangrel is to embrace even the darkest facets of themselves, even if that means welcoming their beast with open arms. When dragged into this unlife, 
  they are subjected to rituals and rites: that range for desertion, to a fight for dominance with another fledgling. It is of little consequence if they fail, because in the eyes of their clan they would never have survived long anyway.
</p>

<p>Anywhere they walk is theirs. Anything they deem worthy of owning is theirs, and you will have to fight them to claim it as your own. They will take what they want, and protect it. Do not cage a dog, or treat them with malice: 
  for it will rip you to shreds, in a moment, or in thirty years time. 
</p>

      <h2 id="malkavian">The Malkavians</h2>
      <p>
Clan Malkavian are a collective of individuals first and foremost. Much more like a dysfunctional family than anything else, they are comprised of seers, doctors, occultists and zealots. 
Where others may perceive enigma, riddle, and confusion: they gleam a stark and terrifying truth about the world. Unravelling the mysteries of the night by intuitively pulling on a thread, and seeing what around them begins to unfurl. 
The Children of Malkav are at their core, solvers and creators of problems. </p>

<p>For months and aeons, they have been the seer on the shoulder of kings, the collectors of trinkets with a common meaning, and the discerners of the best path forward. For seconds and lifetimes they have often been ignored. In the age of information, 
and the politicisation of every spoken word, the clan of the moon are the ones who see through the shit, and observe the predicted conclusions with rapturous applause.</p>

<p>Truly a clan of individuals, Malkavians are as likely to be an educated Doctor in life as they are to be a priest, or a nightclub owner. Condemned to forever find themselves perplexed with a nature they can never quite grasp. 
  A genius perpetually on the verge of a breakthrough, and prisoners who can simply never escape their sentence.</p>

<p>For kindred, truth is anything but objective. For a Malkavian, the truth is all they know, but they can never speak it clear enough for anyone else to comprehend. A fractured mirror, after all, can be pointed at an image, 
   and show its observer a thousand possibilities. Many make the mistake of simply relegating all Malkavians to the sidelines: but would you be content to see the world without all its nuance?</p>

     <section>
      <h2 id="nosferatu">The Nosferatu</h2>
      <p>
The poor, downtrodden, snivelling Nosferatu. They are truly the most unfortunate bunch of Licks. So malformed by the corruption of their blood, the Nosferatu have been hunted for as long as they have existed. Information gatherers, 
technicians, licit traders… The Rats are always in the know. In centuries past they made themselves indispensable to Kindred society by trading in secrets: running the show from shady back rooms and through whispered conversations. 
 </p>

<p>The Camarilla, The Anarchs, The Sabbat… the Nos will more than likely outlive them all. The Horrors have made warrens - homes - in all of them. When you are shunned by a world of monsters, 
  simply because of how you are cursed to be, their sects begin to mean less and less, and a place to belong becomes essential. The Humane amongst Kindred, the Nosferatu have exactly what others are lacking - a fundamental common cause, 
  and camaraderie. The Ratways, sewers, and abandoned hovels in which the Clan of The Hidden make their beds, keeps them hidden. Keeps them safe. Protected. </p>


<p>
They are cursed to appear as horrid, deformed, and wretched as they are inside. A Nosfertau’s body writhes, breaks, shifts, and warps upon their Embrace. It is much more obvious to see why a rat might call themself a monster, 
  when they are reminded every time they are unfortunate enough to see their reflection. When others are more disgusted by you than you could ever be, and you are deemed too unsightly for courts of monsters: 
  you make it your business to have as much dirt on them as possible. Just in case. After all… you have what they lost the day they died… honesty.
</p>

    </section>
     <section>
      <h2 id="toreador">The Toreador</h2>
      <p>
Socialites, Divas, and Artists make up the diverse ranks of the Toreador. There is beauty in all things, and the Clan of the Rose are committed, intentionally or otherwise, to viewing these darkest nights through an aesthetic lens. 
The Artists long hunger for perfection, and can spend centuries trying to relive a moment of ecstasis to no avail. They are a reminder of the destructive capability of art in all forms, cursed to take centre stage in that tragedy. 
There is something divine and irresistible about the tortured and fractured minds of the world they walk through. It is this beauty that they become obsessed with. 
 </p>

<p>To dismiss the Toreador, would be to ignore the power that they carry with them. It is no small feat to entertain and enthral the undead. With a song, a Rose can enchant a room; and with a dance they can start a war. 
    It is no surprise that in eras past, when the world was run from ballrooms and in high courts: that the Toreador were the undisputed linchpins of high society. The ability to make the deceased cry, laugh, and love - 
    to make them feel what they lose upon embrace - is the crowning glory of the Hedonists.
 </p>


<p>
Innocence is but a plaything for them. What is lost can never be regained, and that precise moment in which it is obliterated, is a constant source of fascination for Clan Toreador. Ever selective with who they welcome into their ranks, 
  there is something truly unique in every Sensate. A special perspective, a kernel of spectacular capability: an echo of kaleidoscopic beauty. There is tantalising beauty in the darkness, and the Toreador can all but taste it. A shame, then, 
  that no muse is eternal.
</p>

<section>
      <h2 id="tremere">The Tremere</h2>
      <p>
Every clan has a storied and sordid history, etched into the tapestry of their memories and blood. The Tremere are young, by this metric. But their history is twisted, filled with malice, and betrayal. The specifics may vary, 
        but what is widely held to be true, is that the Tremere were not born. At some point in history, lost to the records of those they usurped, the Hemetics stole their gift of the embrace, and warped into a bastardisation. 
        Whilst some may still hold them in contempt, their skill with blood, occult rituals, and magic makes them indispensable to those in power. Frankly, they have always been too useful to eradicate. </p>

<p>The Warlocks used to conduct themselves in accordance with a complex chain of command. Theft breeds paranoia after all, and in order to keep their inner workings clandestine, The Thaumaturges ensured that they were bound - no, enslaved - 
  to each other. A hierarchy enshrined in blood, and order. In a perfect world, they would have never made enemies. But, the arrogance of the deathless is well-known. In 2008 the core of their Pyramid was levelled in a cataclysm at the hands of 
  the Second Inquisition. How they knew where to attack remains a mystery. Maybe one of their own simply had enough of the despotic nature of their superiors. Ironic, that the Betrayers may have been betrayed.
</p>

<p>n losing their lofty seats, and entrenched rituals that bound them to each other, the Broken Clan’s blood is now simply too weak. Comeuppance for their long list of sins. They can no longer bind each other in blood,or create ghouls. 
  Never again will an Occultist control through their Vitae. Some Tremere demand that the Pyramid be rebuilt, brick by blood stained brick. Others, claim liberation from the shackles, and long to build something new in the ruins. Something better.
