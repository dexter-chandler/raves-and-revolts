  <section><h2 id="statement">Rules Statement - Game Philosophy</h2>
  Before we delve into the meat of the rules for the game, it’s important to make clear where we as organisers stand with implementation of disciplines at our event. First and foremost, LARP is a chance for people to enjoy themselves and delve into the intricacies of the setting: and ensuring that people have the full capability to do so in an enjoyable manner is core to our design philosophy. Player comfort always takes precedent, and we trust our player base to negotiate scenes in a fashion that is in keeping with this. 
  </section><section>
Disciplines, and supernatural powers, are a fundamental part of the Vampire: the Masquerade setting. There would be much less of an allure to playing a supernatural, inhuman, monster without having some form of power that comes with it. We firmly believe that creating and playing a character should take full precedent over playing with disciplines. Frankly, a discipline should only be used in a scene where it makes sense to do so: there is no game to be found in throwing around Dominate constantly. A single, tactful, and well-thought-out use of a power is likely to make far more game for both parties involved than constant and liberal use.
 </section><section>
The following rules are designed to be implemented in play, and should act as a framework for how you play with your powers in game: they are by no means definitive or absolute. Whilst these are our expectations for how disciplines can be anticipated to be used by other players, and denote the strength we think disciplines should have within our event, if you are in a scene where it would be more fun for everyone involved to utilise a stronger power we encourage you to do so! To use a ridiculous example: if it makes sense for a Brujah neonate to use presence to strike fear into an entire room of licks (a power that usually would be reserved for Elders and the like), and everyone involved in the scene is on board for it to happen, then by all means have at it!. 
 </section><section>
That being said, this should always follow a conversation between the person using the discipline, and the recipient(s). The recipient of a discipline always reserves the right to veto any action, for any reason. Not that should be a surprise, given our highlighted stances on conduct. When it comes to negotiating the use of disciplines, we encourage you to first drop character and negotiate the result if the situation allows. You should always check in with your scene-partners when using them. It’s just the best way to ensure that everyone is safe, consenting, and having fun.
</section>

 <section><h2 id="lose">Playing to Lose</h2>    
As mentioned throughout our website, we are firmly of the opinion that players collaborating breeds immersive, beautiful, and impactful stories. Whilst there is so much fun to be had in succeeding in your goals, and accomplishing your ambitions, this can become meaningless if you never lose anything. In fact, often it’s the failures that make a story compelling. Vampire is no different in this sense: in it’s a tragic setting where loss is always around the corner, in your periphery, driving you to do anything you can to escape it. In order for everyone to get to experience the story they want for their characters, other people have to be willing to lose sometimes. This doesn’t mean we want everyone to be failing all the time however! Rather, players should treat each other in a way that allows for people to craft the most enjoyable scene for everyone involved, even if that means taking a loss so that someone else can have a victory. 
</section><section>
To provide an example: let’s say two characters are having an argument, and it looks like it might escalate to a full-blown fight. One might be of higher station (lets say a well established Ventrue in the anarchs) and the other could be a rowdy Caitiff or Brujah underdog. Whilst it may be the case that there is no way in the world this underdog is capable of throwing the Ventrue across the room and humiliating them in the process, the players could negotiate it so that this happens; providing a cool scene for the observers and some drama for those involved. In this case, the Ventrue player is choosing to lose, so that the Caitiff can have a win. As a result of this, later on in the evening, the Ventrue may have a chance at redeeming themselves by “getting back” at the Caitiff, allowing for both players to experience a powerful dynamic wherein both have lost and won at different points in time.
</section><section>
By playing in such a way, and allowing for an openness of negotiation between players, we hope that everyone at the game gets the chance to have their time in the spotlight, and also their time in the dark. Fundamentally, everyone playing at the game is there to enjoy themselves, and a willingness to cooperate and collaborate ensures that this is the case. After all, it’s only a one-shot. Again, this isn’t to say that you have to play-to-lose all the time, but rather that a willingness to embrace such a philosophy is encouraged. Consider this more of an advisory notion than an absolute rule. Players always reserve the right to say no, and there should be no judgement cast against them for doing so. 
 </section><section>
    <section><h2 id="boundaries">Indicator of Boundaries</h2>  
   As part of our event, we will be encouraging players to wear colour-coded wristbands that indicate their comfort level with certain types of roleplay, and the ways in which they would like to be interacted with. This is not only to ensure player safety, but also to give people a clear and physical indicator of how they wish to be approached and engaged within the game. Luckily for us, it’s a Rave, and so wristbands are not exactly immersion breaking. In order for this to work however, players should endeavour to make sure that these are worn in a way that is either visible, or can be easily made visible to others. If you can’t see a player’s wristband, ask them. If you can’t ask, assume it’s RED.
</section><section>
The parameters for each colour are as follows:
</section><section>
RED: “I am not here for any seriously intense roleplay directed solely at me, unless I have deliberately and actively communicated on an out-of-character basis with you that I am. Please do not instigate any intense scenes with me - be they physical or emotional - unless we have had a conversation about boundaries beforehand, and negotiated the outcome. I’m largely just here to be a vampire at a rave and have a nice time”
</section><section>
AMBER: “I am willing to partake in intense roleplay with other players, as long as they go out of their way to approach me about it beforehand, or I approach them. I’m okay with being tangentially involved in intense scenes, and may involve myself in them if I feel comfortable, but that does not mean I am open to everything. Please check in with me first.”
</section><section>
GREEN: “I am more than happy to be involved in spontaneous scenes that are intense, and directly involve myself. Feel free to engage me in this kind of roleplay, and I’ll likely jump at the chance to give as good as I get. I’m here to get involved in the intense side of things emotionally, and love conflict roleplay. Physical roleplay is still something you should check with me first so that we can negotiate it fully.”
</section><section>
To clarify, whilst these are indicators, there may be times wherein someone wearing a GREEN wristband may not be comfortable with pursuing a scene. It shouldn’t be a mark against them at all, as you don’t know what may or may not be a boundary for them. Consent and negotiations are always key, and should be used if you think a topic may potentially be problematic for someone. 
</section><section>
We will provide these wristbands at the game, and players are more than welcome to change them based on comfort levels during the event.
</section>
<section><h2 id="gifts">Gifts of the Blood</h2>  

As part of Character Creation, you will all be given the option of choosing a Clan and the disciplines you would like your Vampire to have. Each Clan has access to three specific disciplines, from which you can then choose powers. For the sake of simplicity, and brevity of creation, we have decided that each player character will have the option to choose one of their clan disciplines as "Higher Level" and the other two at "Lower level". This means that everyone will have one discipline that they are adept in, and two that they are less potent with. 
</section><section>
To provide an example, if you were playing a Brujah, you would have access to Potence, Celerity and Presence. From that you could then choose to have Presence as your "Higher Level" power, and Celerity and Potence as your "Lower Level" powers. This would mean you would have access to "Higher and Lower Level Presence" as well as "Lower Level Potence and Celerity".
</section><section>
What follows is a detailed description of each discipline that exists in our game, and we have provided archetypal examples of the power levels for each tier of that discipline. Obviously, for those of you familiar with Vampire: the Masquerade you will be acutely aware of the scope of each discipline in tabletop, and that we could not have possibly provided rules for everything - or examples for every possible way each power could have been used. It goes without saying, but these are just guidelines and suggestions for what powers we think should be used in play. 
</section><section>
You are more than welcome to suggest different options to us if you wish, or simply run with them in play if the people involved in your scene are comfortable. We aren't strict with what you can and can't do if it is reasonable to do so given the scope of your character's powers. Again, it is a one-shot after all and balance is the last of out concerns.
